Tiles directory holds the textures you want to use to make your own terrainExt.png file. Unpack the Minecraft jar, for example C:\Users\Eric\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\versions\1.6.4\1.6.4.jar. In there you'll see a subdirectory assets\minecraft\textures\blocks. Copy the *.png files from there to this directory.

You can replace whichever *.png files you want with what you want instead.

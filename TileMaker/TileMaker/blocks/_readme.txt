This is where to put any block image PNG files from the "\assets\minecraft\textures\blocks" directory in a Minecraft resource pack in order to make terrainExt.png.

You will also want to put the chest images ender.png, normal.png, and normal_double.png from the "\assets\minecraft\textures\entity\chest" directory into the "chest" subdirectory.

See mineways.html (in the docs directory, or http://mineways.com/mineways.html#tilemaker) about the TileMaker for more information.

Note: in 1.11 on, the barrier.png tile is in "\assets\minecraft"\textures\item(s)" - copy it from there.

      Exporting creates a .zip file by default. To preview your model, unzip the .zip file (there is also a checkbox on export, "Create files themselves", to avoid unzipping) and open the .wrl file with <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a> or other VRML file viewer. If you want to 3D print your model, <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/register">create a free Shapeways account</a> and <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/upload/">upload</a> the <i><b>.zip</b></i> file. Once the model is processed by Shapeways (a few minutes), you can order it - make sure to select "colored sandstone" for the material. As an example, <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/mineways?sg20419%5Bpage%5D=1#sg20419">here's</a> my non-profit store. Note that no part of this process will cost you anything, unless you actually order something.
    </P>
    <P>
      What to try next: check out the <a href="mineways.html#lesser">"Export lesser blocks"</a> feature, which lets you get more detail. This feature is not on by default because it has some risks - read up! To learn more about other options work through the <a href="mineways.html">documentation page</a>, the information is pretty much in order of importance.
    </P>
    <P>
      <b>Super-fast quickstart for rendering:</b> Same as for 3D printing export, but instead select "File | Export for Rendering..." - just hit "OK" on the Options dialog. You can preview the output OBJ file by using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/g3d/files/beta-g3d-cpp/10.00%20beta%203/G3D-10.00-b3-viewer-win64.zip/download">G3D</a>, <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a>, or any other OBJ file viewer. To import the model to a rendering program, <a href="mineways.html#rendering">see this area of the documentation</a>.
    </P>
	<h1>Platform-Specific Stuff</h1>
 		<P>
		For Windows 8, if mineways.exe doesn't work for you, try mineways_windows8.exe. If you are informed that msvcr120.dll is missing, you will need to install the 64-bit version of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784">Visual Studio 2013 redistributables</a> in order to run it.
		<P>
        For Linux, download the Windows version and then use <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">WINE</a> to emulate Windows.
		<P>
		If Mineways is blocked by Norton Antivirus: First, make sure you are downloading Mineways from this site, i.e., the links above. If the download is being autodeleted, <a href="http://community.norton.com/comment/3833313#comment-3833313">here's how to turn Norton off temporarily</a>. Otherwise, just run Mineways and ignore the warnings. <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7cd622325879c6b9218aad6ee9f59ae24271abf610e8a8229c31daef4eebaa7f/analysis/">No other antivirus software</a> reports Mineways as having a virus, so I believe it's a flaw in Norton. I won't be insulted if you are cautious and don't follow my advice, but Mineways is <a href="https://github.com/erich666/Mineways">open source</a>, and <a href="http://erichaines.com">I have a reputation as a good person</a>, so these things count against there being a virus.
    <h2 id="mac">Mac users:</h2>
    <p>Download <a href="http://realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/MinewaysMac.zip">Mineways for Mac</a>.
    <p>
	  Once installed, run Mineways - it'll take awhile to start the first time and you'll get a notice about <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>, so be patient. To load your world, use "File | Open World". If none of your worlds are listed, you'll get a warning and will need to use "File | Open..." and navigate to /users/<I>&lt;your name&gt;</I>/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/<I>&lt;your world's name&gt;</I> and select the level.dat file there.
	<P>
	  By default, Mineways now uses its own tile textures that are stored in the program itself. Other "terrainExt.png" can be used - a number of these come with the program. Use "File | Set Terrain File" and select the terrainExt.png in /users/<I>&lt;your name&gt;</I>/Downloads/MinewaysMac or wherever you put Mineways. You might need to search for these files, just use <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/how-find-lost-mac-os-x-files-3613260/">Spotlight</a> and search on "terrainExt.png". <a href="mineways.html#terrain_png">The other terrainExt*.png files</a> will be found in this directory.
    </p>
	<h3>Troubleshooting for the Mac</h3>
	  If you get the warning '"Mineways"" canâ€™t be opened because the identity of the developer cannot be confirmed.' take steps similar to those <a href="https://support.techsmith.com/hc/en-us/articles/203727998-TechSmith-Relay-Can-t-be-opened-because-the-identity-of-the-developer-cannot-be-confirmed-">explained here</a>.
	<P>
      If you can't see the Application Support/minecraft folder, see <a href="http://www.macinfo.us/how-to-find-minecraft-worlds-on-your-mac.php">this page</a> for how to use the terminal utility to make it visible. Short version: search for "terminal" in spotlight, copy and paste this line into the terminal and hit Enter:
	  <PRE>
	  defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
	  </PRE>
	</p>
	<P>
	  Then type or paste this line:
	  <PRE>
	  killall Finder
	  </PRE>
	</p>
	<P>
	  to restart the finder. You can find your saves folder by opening Finder -> Go -> Go To Folder -> type ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves. For future reference, it's best to make an alias for this folder and copy it to your desktop.
	</p>
	<P>
      Selection is done with right-click; if you are using a trackpad or your mouse cannot right-click, hold down the Control key and left-click, or see <a href="http://www.macinstruct.com/node/66">this page</a> for more options.
    </p>
	<p>
	  The Mac version is only 32 bits, so cannot export very large areas that the PC version can. This normally doesn't matter for 3D printing, since you want to keep the models small. Otherwise it's the same as the PC version, and Mac users can also use <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a> or <a href="http://www.glc-player.net/">GLC Player</a> for viewing exported 3D models. See <a href="mineways.html">the main documentation page</a> for (way) more help.
	<P>
      We use <a href="http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/">WineBottler</a> to make mineways32.exe into a Mac app - it's pretty easy! <a href="images/winebottler.png">Here's a screenshot of the settings</a> I use; I've renamed mineways32.exe to be Mineways.exe for this example. Click "Install", save to "Documents," wait a while, and then you can run (and redistribute) the Mineways.app produced. Note: do <I>not</I> save to the original Mineways directory where the mineways32.exe file is located, as this will cause a loop and the program will never finish.
